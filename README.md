# widget_test_demo

Explored widget testing and wrote a test script to validate appbar and text widget and running the test script by adding Flutter Test configuration in Android Studio, that helps to execute widget test explicitly from AS and see the test results in the pane.
I also wrote an article on it. Read it here [https://medium.com/@darshankawar/writing-and-running-widget-tests-from-android-studio-d63b9fea21c5]
